# btpwm

This is a brand new project, meaning that right now this is a collaboration
space, not a place to pick up reliable code.

The name is still to be determined. "btpwm" is a little opaque and hard to
pronounce.

The concept is a bittorrent password manager. That is to say a password manager
which uses a bittorrent swarm for storage.

There are markdown files under doc which should give you some idea of where the
project is headed. These are also not done! They're getting too long to keep to
myself, though, so I'm putting them up here to finish collaboratively.
