A password entry:

  - is formatted information.  A password entry file contains a password
    entry.  The "entry" is the block of formatted data, not the file
    itself.

  - consists of lines, each of which is taken to be a key:value pair,
    where the first colon is taken to be a field separator.

A key:
  
  - consists of approved characters.  This definitely will not include
    the colon, and almost as certainly will not include the newline.
    The character whitelist may be expanded in the future, but for the
    moment will be defined as:

      - upper
      - lower
      - digits
      - hyphen
      - underscore (special meaning)

  - may have a prefix.  A prefix is simply a string reserved to indicate
    something about a key.  The only prefix currently defined is
    "user_".  This merely indicates that a key was created and set by a
    user.  If another program has heavy interactions with this one, a
    prefix might be established to simulate a namespace for the settings
    saved by that other program.

Defined keys:

  - "login-url" --  Page where credentials should be applied.
  - "username"  --  The username.
  - "password"  --  Password to be used with username.

A complete password entry consists at a minimum of:

  - A context field.  (Login URL, SSH host, etc.)
  - An identity field.  (Username, address, etc.)
  - An authentication field.  (Password, private key, etc.)
