Documentation of inherently sloppy human intentions and plans.

Right now, I want to get password entries working as a thing to be handed
around.

## Sub-tasks:

- Establish firm entry format.
- Establish nominal routine for writing and reading entry files.
- Implement functions to read and write entry files.
- Test with the dummy script.
- The dummy script should prompt the user for the values to use.
